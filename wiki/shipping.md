# Shipping
This is everyones most requested question


I'm going to be honest and say that shipping is Meepo's downfall to an otherwise amazing product.

Thanks to u/jamestakesflight who has created a form which we encourage you to fill out once your board has arrived so we are able to give anyone who wants to know the most accurate shipping times.

The form can be found [here](https://forms.gle/jVfHhKx1J3iSBSox7) and the results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yXgaOHBZoZJtPVxP6klVuYW0VE8DWirPxzv3f8lYxYA). which gets updated automatically. Once we have enough data, I will try do some clicky mappy shit so you can just look at it opposed to having to search

**Things to know before posting about shipping**:

1.Deliveries are taking **up to 50 days by sea**.

2. People in the US are receiving FedEx tracking numbers with "label created" statuses, if it has "label created" and is in Hawthorne, California, it is likely your order hasn't passed customs and the expected ship date you see is not accurate.

3. People in the UK, you can expect around 35-60 days. It will come from all over the place.

Main point to take from this is **do not worry**. You board will arrive. I found that it's best to purchase the board and forget about it till you get the shipping number, check once a week and then once it arrives it's like christmas!!

Meepo have a tracking page [here](https://www.meepoboard.com/apps/trackorder)

**Why does the order number have no update?**

Order with Standard Shipping 

When your skateboard was shipped, you will received an email with a trcking number showing 'order was shipped already'.

You will received an email with tracking number when your package arrives in your country, so you won't have any tracking information during this time.

 Order with Fast Shipping 

We ships fast shipping orders out in 1-2 days, and get tracking number for you within 3-5 days.

[Here is their tracking](https://www.meepoboard.com/pages/faqs)

**Refunds for fast shipping**

I am actually not sure about this. You will need to contact meepo!

**Is my board lost?!?!?!**

No. I am yet to hear of a board getting lost in transit. 

**Shipping seems too good to be true**

In the nicest way possible, after you've read all the above. you tell me (Answer is probably too good to be true)

**Third party resellers**

I have seen a few posts about EBC. I personally dont understand why they exist when they just buy from meepo and have it shipped from meepo. I have seen complains of their shipping times worse, and their communication being worse. Weird.
