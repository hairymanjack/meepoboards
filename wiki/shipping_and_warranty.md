# Warranty and refunds
Oh boy. This one is intresting

**Warranty**

Meepo boards carry a generic 180 day warranty from the date that it arrives at your property. This is done via the tracking number.

There are exceptions which are as of 10 months ago, listed as the campus 2 and the AWD GT.

BUT, meepo make this very confusing as there are 2 contradicting posts. Please look in to this your self as I am doing what I can to put everything you will need in one place.

see [this talking about 180 days](https://support.meepoboard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002069658-Is-there-a-warranty-) and [a 6 month warranty.](https://support.meepoboard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002108877-How-long-is-the-warranty-from-Meepo-Board-)

**Refunds**

You can get a refund if the order has not been processed

Once built, you've got no chance of a refund.

No refund once shipped

Meepo wont refund you if the board is DOA (Dead on arrival) instead they will try fid it.

They don't accept returns.

**Contacting support**

This is one of meepo's biggest issues that I have seen highlighted by this sub.

To contact meepo I suggest going thought their website [here](https://support.meepoboard.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and asking for Nancy in the title and the body. 

Do not come to meepo with a request for help as there is a language barrier which can sometimes cause issues. Instead go to meepo and tell them the issue and all the troubleshooting you've done. (I will look at creating a post for this at some point) Then request parts be sent.  **There is a language barrier. use google translate to chinese and send that below your english words. Ask them to reply in chinese and reverse translate it**
