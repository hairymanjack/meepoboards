# Riding your board for the first time
Awesome, so you just got your board... now what?
I strongly suggest you get a helmet. You will fall off and the last thing you want to do is hit that brain of yours and never be able to skate again.

Once you've got your helmet on, you can start with turning the board on. You can either press the power button on the side of the board, or place it on the floor and give it a good shove. You should hear a beep either way.

Now that the board is on, you will need to connect the controller. Depending on the controller you have, press and hold the power button. It should start with the battery indicated on the remote, then connect to your board. Press the scroll wheel back and push the board. You should hear the breaks lock it. This is important to check... Always check your breaks before going on a ride.

Now that we've got that out the way...  what if the remote does not connect to the board? 

Turn the board on and press and hold the board's power button till it flashes. Around 6-7 seconds.
On the back of the remote (Whilst it's on) you will find a small hole. Press the button in there with a tooth pick or small item. It should pair automatically.

# actually riding the board

Click the power button on the remote, you should see the battery indicator light jump around. You will want to click this till it goes to the bottom.
Welcome to beginner mode!

Before you get on the board, slowly move the scroll wheel forward till the board starts moving. Understand how hard it pulls off, and how much you need to push it forward to start moving. let it run, now break by scrolling backwards.

Start by standing on the board with your feet spread apart, **standing sideways**

Lean so your weight is on your front foot, but your body does not go over the front of the board. Now start to move the scroll wheel forward till you feel the board moving. Try bringing the speed up a little bit at a time! 

**Congrats, you're esk8ting!!**

Now to stop, lean back a smidge, and scroll the wheel backwards till you feel resistance. Once you can feel a little resistance, pull it back a little harder in increments.

So far we have only gone in straight lines..

# turning
From meepo, the bushings on the boards (The funky colored things under the board where the wheels attach to) come a little tight. We will need to loosen them a smidege. Take the orange skate tool you got in the board and turn it 8/9ths of a turn (basically almost all the way)

Do the same for the read, but turn the rear 4/8ths of the way (half turn)

Now hop back on your board and start moving forwards. You will want to apply pressure to your toes, and lean in to the turn. This should start to turn you. 

**congrats, you're turning**

Now to turn the other way, bend your knees, lean back and apply pressure to your heals.

That's all there is to it

# changing modes

⚠️ this should not be done till you're comfortable ⚠️ 

Now that we have been in beginner mode for around a week, click the power button on the board so that the mode moves up. Do what we did earlier where before we get on the board, we check how sensitive the controller is. Do the same for the breaks.

As the modes get higher, you will need to lean more for pulling off as well as breaking!

# wheres muh confidence
Riding takes a long time to get used to. Depending on the board you have, it can take months. Don't give up no matter what.
Personally I watch [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3yG8NWXQQE) who is very good and explaining things and shows you. I suggest you watch the video.
