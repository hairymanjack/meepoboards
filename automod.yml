   Holy cheeze balls /u/{{author}} that's a pretty dank ride you got there!

   Just a gentle reminder for you to fill [this form out](https://forms.gle/jVfHhKx1J3iSBSox7) so we can track how long shipping takes, and then offer help to those who want to know how long it takes.

   To help people who want to know the 'deets' as the cool kids say, please tell us: Date ordered, date arrived and country

   Also please reply to this comment and tag u/chin_waghing with the model of board you got so we can add a snazzy flair to your username!
