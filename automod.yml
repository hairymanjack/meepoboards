    Looks like your post has been flaired as a question!

    This is just a heads up, if we find that your question was answered in the FAQ post, your post will be removed

    We do this to keep the front page clean with quality posts, but at the same time we know you're looking for help and really want you to get it.

    Another way to avoid removal is to make the question not personal-- that is, reframe the question as a discussion. That way you can get a lot more perspectives from a wider variety of answers.

    Thanks for posting and we hope you find your answer!
