Hi Guys.

With everyone recently posting shipping posts and questions that have been answered. I am going to try and put them all in to one post. I hope this is of help. Let me know if there's anything you want added!

**First call is shipping**.

I'm going to be honest and say that shipping is Meepo's downfall to an otherwise amazing product.

Thanks to u/jamestakesflight who has created a form which we encourage you to fill out once your board has arrived so we are able to give anyone who wants to know the most accurate shipping times.

The form can be found [here](https://forms.gle/jVfHhKx1J3iSBSox7) and the results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yXgaOHBZoZJtPVxP6klVuYW0VE8DWirPxzv3f8lYxYA).

(OG post for this can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeepoBoards/comments/gslvde/master_delivery_date_google_sheet_and_google_form/))

**Things to know before posting about shipping**:

1.Deliveries are taking **up to 50 days by sea**.

People in the US are receiving FedEx tracking numbers with "label created" statuses, if it has "label created" and is in Hawthorne, California, it is likely your order hasn't passed customs and the expected ship date you see is not accurate.

People in the UK, you can expect around 35-60 days. It will come from all over the place.

Main point to take from this is **do not worry**. You board will arrive. I found that it's best to purchase the board and forget about it till you get the shipping number, check once a week and then once it arrives it's like christmas!!

Meepo have a tracking page [here](https://www.meepoboard.com/apps/trackorder)

**Why does the order number have no update?**

Order with Standard Shipping 

When your skateboard was shipped, you will received an email with a trcking number showing 'order was shipped already'.

You will received an email with tracking number when your package arrives in your country, so you won't have any tracking information during this time.

 Order with Fast Shipping 

We ships fast shipping orders out in 1-2 days, and get tracking number for you within 3-5 days.

Now that we have covered everything I can think of for shipping. we will look at the warranty and refunds and how to contact support.

**Warranty**

Meepo boards carry a generic 180 day warranty from the date that it arrives at your property. This is done via the tracking number.

There are exceptions which are as of 10 months ago, listed as the campus 2 and the AWD GT.

BUT, meepo make this very confusing as there are 2 contradicting posts. Please look in to this your self as I am doing what I can to put everything you will need in one place.

see [this talking about 180 days](https://support.meepoboard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002069658-Is-there-a-warranty-) and [a 6 month warranty.](https://support.meepoboard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002108877-How-long-is-the-warranty-from-Meepo-Board-)

&#x200B;

**Refunds**

You can get a refund if the order has not been processed

Once built, you've got no chance of a refund.

No refund once shipped

Meepo wont refund you if the board is DOA (Dead on arrival) instead they will try fid it.

They don't accept returns.

**Contacting support**

This is one of meepo's biggest issues that I have seen highlighted by this sub.

To contact meepo I suggest going thought their website [here](https://support.meepoboard.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and asking for Nancy in the title and the body. 

Do not come to meepo with a request for help as there is a language barrier which can sometimes cause issues. Instead go to meepo and tell them the issue and all the troubleshooting you've done. (I will look at creating a post for this at some point) Then request parts be sent.

&#x200B;

Do note that their support take a long time to get back and many times they will pull the Friday 5pm trick. Be patient!

If there is anything I have missed, or you have any questions please feel free to reach out and let me know! I am more than happy to help in what ever way I can

(also I'll put this out there. I am in no way affiliated with meepo. I work and live in the UK :) )
