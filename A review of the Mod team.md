Hello People.

By now I've been a mod for about a month maybe? Lock down has merged all days in to one.

If you have the time (around 2-3 minutes) please can you fill [this form out](https://forms.gle/w567xct4ZqbjNcCm8) with complaints and anything you want to see change.

There is also a part where you can just let me know how you feel, and what needs to change if it was not covered by the questions.

As always, if you have an issue with how something was handled please reach out and i will do what I can to make it right!
